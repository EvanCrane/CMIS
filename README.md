# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING MINIFIED FILES #

-min.js and -min.css files are autogenerated by gulp tasks. 

In order to regenerate min files for css and js, go through the following instructions.

    In order for gulp to work, node.js and npm must be installed. 
    More info can be seen here 
    https://nodejs.org/en/
    https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

    To make sure node.js and npm have installed run
    "node -v"
    "npm -v"

    All necessary packages are listed in package-lock.json. To install them use the command
    "npm install"

    Gulp should already be installed with this command. More info can be seen here https://gulpjs.com/
    To verify use:
    "gulp -v"

    Once that has completed you can use gulp commands defined in gulpfile.js. 
    "gulp minify-js" this command automatically minifies all js files and places them in ../scripts/dist/
    "gulp minify-css" this command automatically minifies all css files and places them in ../css/dist/
